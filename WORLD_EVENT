1) How to trigger event:
   Click on any Vein. Event will not occur if you click on any other entity.

2) What should happen, 3) What the affected entities should do, 4) What the new entity is/should behave:
   The vein that you clicked on will then turn into a new Entity called a MonsterBomb.
   This MonsterBomb, after a short amount of time and an animation to show progress, will "explode" and create a patch of "bad" grass that is 5x5 blocks in size.
   Where ever that bad grass is a Monster entity can spawn. The Monster entities are drawn to OreBlobs, and will essentially eat the OreBlobs where ever they are.
   The Miners, however, are repulsed by the Monster entities and cannot move within a 3x3 box around the Monster entity. (This can be seen by mousing over the Miners when they are moving if a Monster is in there way).
   If a Vein is in the patch of bad grass that spawns then it will be replaced by a SuperVein which has a different appearance from a normal Vein and will spawn Ores at the same distance as a normal Vein but at a much quicker speed.
   OreBlobs will try to destroy the closest Vein or SuperVein no matter which type it is.
